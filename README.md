## data structures

### beam

- origin: cartesian coordinate (x, y, z) where the beam starts
- length: the distance from the start to the end of the beam
- direction: the angles for a spherical coordinate system
  - inclination: rotation about the Y axis, from the +Z axis, toward the +X axis
  - azimuth: rotation about the Z axis, from the +X axis, toward the +Y axis

### rotation

beams and skins are represented as a spherical coordinate system, where:

- origin: the di
- length: the distance from the origin to the end of the 
// Direction is how to rotate beams and skins.
//   the length is along
// a Direction message represents a beam's direction as angles of spherical coordinate system.
// - altitude: the angle between the horizon and "up", around the x-axis.
// - azimuth: the angle around the horizon, around the z-axis.
