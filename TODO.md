rotation / direction / wtf:

- spherical coordinates work for beams because we don't care about roll
- good to add "rotate +X", etc buttons to rotate around axes
  - but can clear "rotate +X" button when beam is parallel to axis
- maybe cartesian coordinates are better, because easier to do a 3-4-5 triangle angle

- bug: unlengthen < 0
- share button
- make gridbeam-sizes module
- include gridbeam size in beam part

- make gridbeam-sizes module
  - https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Gridbeam#Versions
- include gridbeam size in beam part
- change measurement system (imperial or metric)
- change current size
- snap to standard lengths
  - override with $key
- allow part-way rotations

- undo and redo (back button)
  - do this better, ctrl+z, ctrl+shift+z
- copy and paste
